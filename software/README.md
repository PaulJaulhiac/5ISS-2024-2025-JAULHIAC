# GasSensor-project 

This folder contains the work done on the Bluetooth communication with the Android App (software/BT_App/BT_App.ino)
The work on sensor data process and display on the OLED screen (software/Gas_Sensor-OLED_Screen-W/Gas_Sensor-OLED_Screen-W.ino)
Finally, you can find some attempts at using Nunchuk Controls (software/Nunchuk_Controls/Nunchuk_Controls.ino), but this was a work in progress so it's not implemented in the OLED screen application
