# 5ISS-2024-2025-JAULHIAC

This repository contains work I conducted as a part of the courses around the fabrication of a nano-particles based gas sensor and the processing of its data.

## Description

This project integrates:
1. **Datasheet for a gas sensor** to measure gases like Ammonia (NH3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and Ethanol (C2H6O).
2. **A mobile application** for control and display, using a Bluetooth connection to a microcontroller (ESP32).
3. **An Arduino system**, on an ESP32 board to manage sensor data by processing and allowing communication with the mobile app.

### Objectives of the project:
- Make a nano-particles based gas sensor in lab.
- Implement an adaptation system for a PCB, to recover measurements from the sensor.
- Monitor gas concentrations and trigger alerts when necessary, from a ÂµC.
- Remotely control features via the app.

- Android smartphone with the MITappinventor app installed.

### ðŸ”¹ Code Installation:
1. **Arduino:**
   - Upload the `.ino` files to the Arduino using the IDE.
   - Connect the sensor and Bluetooth module following the provided schematic.
2. **Mobile Application:**
   - Install the generated APK for Android.
   - Enable Bluetooth and connect the app to the ÂµC.

### ðŸ”¹ Usage:
- Launch the mobile app.
- Connect to the Bluetooth module.
- Use buttons or voice commands to interact.
